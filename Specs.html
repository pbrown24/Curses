			<h2>Curses</h2>
        <ul>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
        Curses is a stat and time managment game that forces difficult decisions from a series of events.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
        Players should feel a little stress as they are forced to make difficult decisions and gamble on the lives of their fellow explorers.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Genre:</strong>
        Stat/resource management.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Game play:</strong>
        A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
        The prototypes goal is to simulate one of the many events the game would ask the player to deal with and lays down some of the basic features.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Features:</strong>
        Fast paced time and resource managment. Randomly generated event orderings. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
        This game is set in the 1940's on an expedition into a long lost tomb. The expedition successfully traverses the seemingly safe and linear tomb. Upon reaching the tomb's antichamber, the explorer's find an ancient artifact worth a fortune. In their haste to recover the artifact they release a curse, a creeping dark sickly fog. As the expedition leader, it's your responsibility to get as many explorers out alive as possible, but the task won't be easy. In addition to the cursed fog that is chasing the group, numerous machinations have awoken within the tomb and the layout itself has become contorted and obscured with traps. What first seemed a trivial expedition, has quickly become a struggle to escape with anything at all. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Story:</strong>
         The gameplay's narrative is tied to the gameplay mechanics, players have health, the resource that simply governs whether they are alive or dead, and pace that is an interaction with the creeping fog as explorers try to keep "paces" in front of the fog. While explorers may fall behind, an RNG roll determines whether they will stumble into the fog and vanish. The aesthetic also adds to the gusto of the game.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
        People who enjoy quick games(mobile) with some strategy will enjoy this in addition to people who enjoy board games.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Play time:</strong>
        10-15 mins
        </li>

        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
        Players who can do quick arithmetic and dutifully manage their pace will be more likely to be successful in getting a greater number of explorers out alive.
        </li>

        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
        This game most resembles the card game Hearthstone. In an "adventure" mode boss battle, they featured some similar mechanics such as health, turns to escape, and a "explorer" theme.
